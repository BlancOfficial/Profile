						<p id="text10"><span class="p">I have always loved the arts, this manifested in me first as a love for music, driving me to hone my skills, which finally lead me to achieving a distinction at Grade 7 Singing ABRSM and Piano at Grade 2 ABRSM. I come from a bilingual family, communicating in both Malayalam and English within my home environment, developing my passion for languages and in turn I grew to develop a love for the different nuances in languages and the subtlety of how thought and emotion are conveyed in conversation. It was around this time in my life that I encountered the art of code</span><span class="p">Code had always seemed like a foreign concept to me, I knew it existed, I knew it was there but the stereotypes of quick flashing green walls of text intimidated me... and it intrigued me. The languages rooted in logic and math, each with their own nuances, terminology and applications, the sheer power of creativity in my hands amazed me.</span><span class="p">And so I have entered coding competitions and have taken part in new and emerging programming startups. Most notably, I have worked alongside leading community programmers in the development of the recent Stable Diffusion image generation AI by Stability.Ai, having a great interest in this industry I have applied myself and developed skills outside of my curricular studies, this allowed me to experience first hand the development of this AI, learning more about how these Artificial Intelligence Models work and their downsides. I also learned team working skills aswell as communication as we had to remain coordinated.</span><span class="p">I have also worked on other code-based projects, spending over 200 hours on &quot;BlancoBot&quot;, my reaction bot created to work with Discord API. During the process, I was able to learn skills such as time management, resource allocation and workflow organisation, whilst also self-learning the programming language of &quot;(Node) JavaScript&quot;, constantly upgrading my project for faster runtimes and more efficiency as I developed my skills.</span></p>
